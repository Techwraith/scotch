##Scotch
###A really classy, dead simple, markdown based, blogging framework for node.js

*Scotch isn't ready for prime time yet, use it at your own risk.*

To try Scotch for yourself, make sure that you have node, npm, geddy (`npm install -g geddy`), and mongo installed and do this:

    $> git clone git://github.com/Techwraith/scotch.git
    $> cd scotch && geddy

Go to http://localhost:4000/install to install Scotch.

Your blog should be up and running on http://localhost:4000
