#Scotch
###A really classy, dead simple, markdown based, blogging framework for node.js

To try Scotch for yourself, make sure that you have node, npm, geddy (`npm install -g geddy`), and mongodb installed (and running), then do this:

    $> git clone git://github.com/Techwraith/scotch.git
    $> cd scotch && npm install && sudo geddy

Go to http://0.0.0.0/dashboard/install to install Scotch.

Your blog should be up and running on http://localhost
